TAKSI manual v0.5                                            November 18, 2004
==============================================================================


0. About:
---------
Taksi is a screenshot/video-capture program for 3D applications (games, and 
etc.) Currently, it works with DirectX 8, DirectX 9, and OpenGL applications.
(Support for older DirectX interfaces may be implemented in the future)
Taksi is free software.


1. Current state / What's new:
------------------------------
BETA. DirectX 8 / DirectX 9 / OpenGL support implemented.
This is a "bug-fixing/internal enhancements" release. Changes made include:

New in 0.5:
- slight modification of DLL-mapping/hooking algorithm. Now hooks more
reliably. Also, is now able to re-map into the application, after being
temporarily unmapped (for example: after WarCraft III cinematics)
- added an option to capture full-size video. 
This is an experimental feature and it is turned off by default. 
Be advised that this feature works fine for small-screen windowed apps,
but doesn't yet provide acceptable performance in games played in 
full-screen. Also, the hard disk space is consumed 4 times faster
than during regular half-sized video capture.


2. Supported operating systems:
-------------------------------
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME,
Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP.


3. Capture specifications:
--------------------------
Screenshot format: 24 bit BMP files.
Video: uncompressed AVI-files (no audio).


4. Games/Apps tested with:
--------------------------
Direct3D 8: 
   Pro Evolution Soccer 3, Winning Eleven 7 International,
   F1 2001, FIFA 2003, WarCraft III.
   Unreal Tournament 2003, Unreal Tournament 2004,
   3DMark2001 SE.
Direct3D 9:
   Prince of Persia: Sands of Time,
   Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude,
   3DMark03.
OpenGL:
   DOOM 3, Return To Castle Wolfenstein (demo),
   Tennis Critters (demo), PyOpenGL bindings.


5. Usage:
---------

STEP 1. Run taksi.exe
STEP 2. Run a game that uses one of the supported APIs (DX8, DX9 or OpenGL)
        (The order of these two steps is not important for taksi. It should be
        able to hook on the game in either case.)

STEP 3. Look at left top corner of the screen. 
        If you see a green rectangle in there, then Taksi was able
        to sucessfully hook on the game.


6. Default keys:
----------------

F5: Turn visual indicator ON/OFF.
F6: Toggle system-wide hook mode. When ON (indicator turns blue), allows 
     for mapping into multiple applications, but may have a strong negative
     effect on the overall performance of the system. Recommended state: OFF.
     (The hot-key is disabled, when Taksi uses DirectInput for keyboard
     handling.)
F7: Small screenshot (WIDTH/2 x HEIGHT/2).
F8: Regular screenshot (WIDTH x HEIGHT).
ScrollLock: Video capture ON/OFF (Writes an uncompressed AVI-file).
     (Dimensions of the video are WIDTH/2 x HEIGHT/2.)


7. IMPORTANT DISK SPACE CONSIDERATIONS:
---------------------------------------
Taksi writes uncompressed AVI files. Basically, this means you need a lot
of free disk space. (Once captured, the AVI-files can be compressed into
much smaller files, using the tools like an excellent free software
program, called VirtualDub by Avery Lee.) However, at the time of
capture, for performance reasons, no compression is done, which means that
video files grow large very fast.

There is no time limit in the video capture mode, so the only constraint
is the available disk space. Keep this in mind, when setting the directory
for you captured videos.


8. Configuration:
-----------------
Taksi uses configuration file, called "taksi.cfg". It is optional, so the 
program can operate without it, using built-in default settings. 
The configuration file is managed automatically by Taksi (it is read
on start-up, and updated when "Save And Apply" button is clicked.).
However, it can be edited manually as well.

The following options exist:

1) Basic capture options:
=========================

Capture directory ("capture.dir"): 
This is the directory, where your screenshots and video will be stored. 
IMPORTANT: This directory must exist before any capture is attempted.

Target frame rate ("movie.frameRate.target"):
Desired frame rate of the captured video. So-called "Adaptive" algorithm
uses this setting. When Adaptive algorithm is used, Taksi will try to 
capture the video that will run at specified frame rate, and appear to 
be of the same speed as the actual game. 
NOTE: This doesn't always work well. It seems to work fine for applications
with high frame rate, but often poorly for low frame rate apps. This
Adaptive algorithm is still work-in-progress, so hopefully, i'll be able
to improve it.
If it fails to deliver decent videos, try using "Custom settings", which
are described below.

2) Hot-key mappings:
====================
Define keys that trigger the actions: screen shot capture, video capture,
indicator appear/disappear, global hook mode.

NOTE: Sometimes, the hot-keys may be slow to respond, or not-responsive
at all. First thing to try is to re-assign the hot-keys as they may clash
with some other actions in the game that are triggered by these keys.
If that doesn't help, try changing the value for "useDirectInput"
configuration option, described in the next section.

3) Advanced options:
====================
These options you may never need to change. 
That said, there are certainly use cases, when you might want (or need)
to modify them.

"startup.hookMode.systemWide" : 0/1
Takes boolean values, where 0 - means that taksi should go into 
"exclusive" mode once an application is hooked, effectively meaning that 
no other application will be hooked until this application exits, or 
taksi exits and unhooks from it. 1 - means stay in system wide mode, 
allowing many apps to be hooked in parallel. Typically, you would
want Taksi to go to exclusive mode as soon as possible, because
system-wide mode requires extra message processing by the OS, and
may slow down the whole system. However, system-wide mode is useful 
when you want to run many windowed apps at the same time and hook them 
all with Taksi. (Remember that HOOK_MODE hot-key can still be used from 
any of those applications to switch back-and-forth between the modes)
Recommended default: 0

"keyboard.useDirectInput" : 0/1
Takes boolean values. Allows to pick one of two methods of handling 
hot-keys: either through a keyboard hook procedure (value 0), or by 
using DirectInput interface from DirectX 8 API (value 1). Typically
you would want to use DirectInput, because it allows to correctly
handle hot-keys across wider range of applications. In fact, for 
some apps (like 3DMark2001 SE), using DirectInput may be the only way
to capture hot-key toggles. Using keyboard hook can be a better 
alternative when you want to hook multiple applications at the same
time (i.e. "system-wide" mode), and want to send hot-key commands
separately to each application: in other words, the one with
keyboard focus will receive the hot-key toggles, but others will not.
(When DirectInput is used, all hooked apps will receive and process
the hot-key events simultaneously, which may not be desirable).
Recommended default: 1

"movie.fullSize" : 0/1
Takes boolean values. Allows to capture video in either "half-size"
mode, when frames are reduced by half in each dimension, or in 
"full-size" mode, when frames are kept as they are in the game.
Warning: performance issues exist with full-size video capture, if 
used in high-resolution modes (1024x768 and higher). Use it only 
if you really need to, and you have a very fast graphics card, and
you have tons of hard drive space.
Recommended default: 0

NOTE: There is no way to modify the values of these settings via GUI,
so in order to make a change, you need to manually edit the config file
(using any text editor), and then restart Taksi.

4) Custom video settings:
=========================
This is the alternative to Adaptive mode.
Custom settings come in groups, with each group having a unique id. 
There are 3 settings in a group: pattern, frame rate, and frame weight.
Pattern allows you to select which application(s) should be handled by
this custom settings group. When taksi.dll is mapped into an application,
it checks if any part of applications's full executable filename matches
the pattern of any group. Usually, you can just specify the name of
the game's main executable file, but sometimes you may wish to be more
or less specific. Frame rate is the frame rate of captured video.
Frame Weight specifies how much each game frame should contribute to
captured video frame. 
Examples of weight setting:
1.0  - every frame of the game will be captured in the video. 
4.0  - every frame of the game will be duplicated 4 times in the 
       captured video. (You rarely would wanna use something like 
	   that though). 
0.33 - approximately every 3rd frame of the game is captured in the video.
0.4  - 2 out of 5 frames are captured.

Keep in mind that custom settings may deliver very weird results of
either very slow or very fast videos. You may need to experiment with 
the settings. However, i found out that for some applications, good
custom settings can deliver much better (and smaller) videos than the ones
captured in Adaptive mode.
