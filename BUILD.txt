BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================

The Makefile (in the src folder) is intended to be used by Microsoft NMAKE 
tool, which comes with Visual C++ 6. You will need the following 3rd-party
software to build this program:

1. DirectX 9 SDK 
(Modify the Makefile so that it points to correct location
of the SDK on your disk. Default is \DXSDK9)

2. OpenGL main header file (gl.h)
(Usually is installed in Visual Studio standard location for headers.
If not, modify the Makefile accordingly.)

3. STL (Standard Template Library), which is available freely from SGI. 
(Modify the Makefile accordingly so that it points to correct location
on your disk. Default is \STL)

Three types of build are supported by the current Makefile: 
"debug", "release", and "perf".

To perform "debug" build, just type "nmake".
To perform "release" build, type "nmake release".
To perform "perf" build, type "nmake perf".

Currently, the difference between "debug" and "release" builds is in the
way the debug configuration parameter is treated. The "release" build
ignores debug values > 1, while "debug" build provides more detailed 
logging for debug > 1. This behaviour, however, may change in the future.

The third type fo build - "perf" - can be used to gather performance
statistics, using CLOCK_START and CLOCK_STOP_AND_LOG macros from log.h

(NOTE: You can also build the EXE and DLL files separately, using 
appropriate targets, specified in the Makefile.)
