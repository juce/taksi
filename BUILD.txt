BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================

The Makefile (in the src folder) is intended to be used by Microsoft NMAKE 
tool, which comes with Visual Studio. You will need the following 3rd-party
software to build this program:

1. OpenGL main header file (gl.h)
(Usually is installed in Visual Studio standard location for headers.
If not, modify the Makefile accordingly.)

BUILD:
~~~~~~

1. Modify setenv.cmd file - to set correct path for vsvarsall.bat
2. Open a new command window and run setenv.cmd

Ready to build now:

Three types of build are supported by the current Makefile: 
"debug", "release", and "perf".

To perform "debug" build, just type "nmake".
To perform "release" build, type "nmake release".
To perform "perf" build, type "nmake perf".

Currently, the difference between "debug" and "release" builds is in the
way the debug configuration parameter is treated. The "release" build
ignores debug values > 1, while "debug" build provides more detailed 
logging for debug > 1. This behaviour, however, may change in the future.

The third type fo build - "perf" - can be used to gather performance
statistics, using CLOCK_START and CLOCK_STOP_AND_LOG macros from log.h

(NOTE: You can also build the EXE and DLL files separately, using 
appropriate targets, specified in the Makefile.)
